# DevOps_Article

!! No need to run the seeds and the migrations independently for the tables to be created, just follow the sign up page and the tables will be created automatically.

PS: If testing on localhost, make sure to create the database using the following command in your "http://localhost/phpmyadmin":

<script> CREATE DATABASE devops_article </script>

If testing using the <a href="52.47.74.242"> public IP</a>, then you don't need to run this command and just proceed to the index.html
